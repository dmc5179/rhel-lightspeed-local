# rhel-lightspeed-local
RHEL LightSpeed Local Agent Deployment

- Download your OpenShift pull-secret from console.redhat.com
- Setup authentication with container registry
```console
mkdir ~/.docker
cp pull-secret ~/.docker/config.json
```

- Create config dir that doesn't always exist for new users
```console
mkdir $HOME/.config
```

- May need to configure SELinux for device passthrough
```console
sudo setsebool -P container_use_devices true
```

- Command to install
```console
podman run -u : --rm -v $HOME/.config:/config:Z -v $HOME/.local/bin:/config/.local/bin:Z registry.redhat.io/rhel-cla/installer-rhel10:latest install-systemd
```

# Configuring GPU

- Install Nvidia kernel driver for RHEL
- Install CUDA 12.4 or higher
- sudo dnf install nvidia-ctk
- sudo mkdir /etc/cdi
- sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml # Must run each time the GPUs change like stopping and starting an EC2 GPU based instance

# Configuring another RHEL server to connect to RHEL lightspeed on your GPU box
# On the separate client machine I edited the file to set

- Install clad
```console
sudo dnf -y install command-line-assistant
```

- Edit clad config
```console
sudo vim /etc/xdg/command-line-assistant/config.toml
```

- If using an OpenShift Route
enpoint = "http://ocp-route:80"  # Router exposes 80 which forwards to service 8000

- Direct RHEL endpoint
endpoint = "http://10.0.35.196:8000/" # This is the RHEL GPU server running the lightspeed pod

- Disable SSL if needed
verify_ssl = false # Since we are not using SSL in this case. Maybe could add in a cert on the rhel-lightspeed side? Unsure

- Restart clad
```console
sudo systemctl restart clad
```

- Ask clad a question. The first time can take much longer to respond
```console
c "what is an immutable file?"
```

# OpenShift Deployment


# Potential Bugs?

- default env file shows this: HOST_DEVICE="/dev/dri" but uses image LLAMACPP_IMAGE="quay.io/ramalama/ramalama:latest" # These don't seem to go together

- rhel-lightspeed start will return but rhel-lightspeed status will show that the API is not available for 10-15 seconds. Maybe the start script should wait until the API is available?

- rhel-lightspeed stop command doesn't cleanup the containers or pods, especially if there is a failed start command
